Ferries
====

##Description
 This ingenious project works to matches people's food orders with potential delivery people. When you want to get food from outside but don't want to get up. You can post a listing on this site that asks for someone to deliver popcorn chicken from Ferries. Users will see the listing and if they can fulfill the order they will message the listing's poster and negotiate the delivery fee. The chosen delivery person will bring the food to the appointed time and location and be reimbursed for cost and labour.
